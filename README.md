# Named Entity Recognition (NER) Project

This NER project is an advanced implementation for extracting key pieces of information, known as named entities, from textual documents. Named entities can encompass names of people, places, organizations, dates, and more. Our NER model leverages deep learning techniques, including bidirectional recurrent neural networks (LSTM).

## Features

- Named Entity Recognition using deep learning techniques.
- Bidirectional LSTM neural network for better accuracy.
- Preprocessing tools for text data.
- Evaluation metrics included.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/achrefdhibi/Named_Entity_Recognition_.git
   cd ner-project
